//INTER-THREAD COMMUNICATION
//THE PROBLEM IN THE BELOW CODE IS, THERE ARE TWO THREADS MAIN AND THREAD-0, WHEN I TRY TO 
//PRINT THE VALUE OF COLLECTION IT GIVES US 0 BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SOP STATEMENT IN THE 
//MAIN THREAD AND THREAD-0 HAS NOT FINISHED THE PROCESSING, TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE WE
//CAN USE WAIT AND NOTIFY
package com.practice.Multithreading;

//class TicketCalculator extends Thread {
//	int collection = 0;

//	public void run() {

//		TicketCalculator thread1 = new TicketCalculator();
//		thread1.start();

//IN THE BELOW CODE THE MAIN THREAD WILL WAIT FOR THE THREAD-0 TO COMPLETE ITS JOB
//NOTE: WHEN WORKING WITH WAIT AND NOTIFY OUR CODE SHOULD BE SYNCHRONIZED
